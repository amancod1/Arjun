## About
Arjun is an AI Software Engineer that can understand high-level human language or instructions, break them down into multiple steps, research and solve each steps one by one, and write code to achieve the given goal or objective.

Here's Arjun explained in simpler language:

Imagine a super smart coding buddy named Arjun. You tell Arjun what kind of software you want to build, and he figures out the steps to make it happen. He can even search the web to find the best way to do things!

Arjun is like a combination of a superpowered dictionary, a really good planner, and a coding whiz. He helps you write the code to turn your ideas into working software,  whether you need a small fix or a whole new program.  This means you can spend less time writing code and more time on the fun creative stuff!
